      All Our Friends Liner Notes
		</p>
		<p>
      All Our Friends was intended to be a concept album that would be about all of our friends. Turns out, writing music was harder than we thought, so now it's a concept EP about some of our friends. Pure coincidence that all of them are about girls :)
